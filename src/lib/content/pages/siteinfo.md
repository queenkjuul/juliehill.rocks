# About This Site

This site itself is a part of my portfolio. It was built from scratch using modern tooling and best practices. It is also designed to be reusable - all personal information is contained in a central config file, and all content is stored in Markdown (rendered courtesy of mdsvex). It is definitely geared towards use by developers, and some of the customization might not be totally intuitive to someone that doesn't know any programming.

Deployment is handled via Cloudflare Pages, which was astonishingly easy and even integrated with GitHub PRs without any work on my end. We love it when things Just Work™️, don't we, folks?

Normally I prefer to self-host as much as I can, but I already use Cloudflare for proxying and caching on my self-hosted services, and a totally free, fully automatic, continuously deployed solution that I could control and monitor from an app I already use was too good to pass up. I run a host of services on my LAN as well as [my hobby website](https://queenkjuul.com) which are all hosted in Docker containers on an ancient i7 Ubuntu box in my closet.
